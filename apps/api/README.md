# battleship-api

Optional Node/Express backend for the Battleship Bot. The web app should continue to function without this service; it can be used later for heavier computation or persistence.

## Development
- Run `npm run dev --workspace apps/api` to start the placeholder server.
- Routes and controllers are stubbed; wire them up once backend features are defined.
